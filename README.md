## Features

- **Sleep Detection**: Analyzes eye or facial features to detect if a student appears to be falling asleep.
- **Emotion Detection**: Recognizes 7 basic emotions to gauge student engagement and mood.
- **Face Orientation**: Tracks where students are looking to assess attentiveness.
- **Student Detection**: Detects the presence or absence of students and counts how many are visible.
- **Phone Detection**: Identifies if students are using phones during class time.
